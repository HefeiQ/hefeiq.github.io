 Given a large-scale Spatio-temporal database, how to effectively and efficiently identify strongly related features from a mass of features and remove the irrelevant or less important features which do not contribute much to the target feature, in order to achieve better accuracy for predictive models, is a critical and challenging issue. The optimal sub feature set that contains all the useful information is called Markov Boundary. The existing feature selection methods often focus on identifying one Markov Boundary, which is always not true in the real-world data. In  our work, we evaluate the existing state-of-the-art streaming feature selection methods on meteorological data for  identifying the precursors to heavy precipitation event clusters, and design a new multiple Markov boundaries based predictive model for long lead rainfall forecasting.


 The ultimate goal of the feature selection method is to identify the feature set most relevant to the target feature,which is called the Markov boundary. In an ideal situation, the joint probability distributionPis faithful toG(thegraph of the Bayesian network), there is a unique Markov boundary of the target variable. However, in real-worlddata, the faithfulness condition is always violated because of the occurrence of hidden variables, hypothesis test errors and some fake relevance of pure chances. This makes the Markov boundary of the target variable not uniquein common situations.Motivated by this, we design a new algorithm, [Galaxy]({{ 'zhuang2018galaxy/paper.pdf' | prepend: '/assets/pdf/' | relative_url }}), to identify multiple Markov boundaries through equiv-alent information exploration.   We first determine a Markov boundary $M$, and then we try to replace $A\inM$ with the potential equivalent feature setBexplored from the residual features through correlation and performanceanalysis.We applied Galaxy to an extremely high-dimensional meteorological data set, and finally determined 15 Markovboundaries related to heavy rainfall events that occurred in the Des Moines River Basin in Iowa, where the smallestsize is 4 and the largest the size is 13.  High-weighted Markov boundary identified an important precursor to thesurface  weather  over  the  United  States  is  the  cold  surges  along  the  coast  of  Asia,  which  is  agreed  by  climateexperts.
