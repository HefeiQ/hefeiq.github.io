I am a Senior data scientist at Constant Contact. I received my Ph.D. degree in applied machine learning at the Knowledge Discovery Lab in Computer Science Department at UMass Boston, advised by Prof. Ding Wei.

My Ph.D. research focused on developing applied machine learning algorithms to solve real-world computational problems, mainly focused on Spatio-temporal analysis and time series forecasting. 
I am also passionate about applying causal analysis techniques in feature selection to study how to identify the principal features from the original feature space. 
 
Before UMass Boston, I had been a software engineer in China for over five years in map-based web application design. I obtained my M.S. degree in Computer Science from the University of Massachusetts, Boston, in 2016. Prior to that, I received my B.E. degree in Computer Science from Harbin Engineering University in Harbin, China.

In my spare time, I enjoy traveling and hiking with friends and family.
