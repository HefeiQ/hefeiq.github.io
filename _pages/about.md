I am an Assistant Professor in the School of Computing at Grand Valley State University (GVSU). With a strong foundation in both academia and industry, my passion lies in exploring the practical applications of technology. I earned my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Massachusetts Boston.

Boasting over six years of industrial experience as a web application developer and machine learning engineer, I have refined my skills to create real-world solutions. My research interests are centered on machine learning and data mining, with a specialized focus on spatio-temporal analysis, time series forecasting, and the inventive application of causal analysis techniques in feature selection.

Prior to joining GVSU, I held the position of Senior Data Scientist and accumulated extensive experience as a software engineer, primarily in web application design. My Ph.D. research was devoted to developing applied machine learning algorithms to tackle complex, real-world computational challenges.

In my leisure time, I take pleasure in exploring city parks, hiking, and playing board games or video games with friends and family. A dedicated fan of science fiction and action movies, I have a particular affinity for the James Bond series.

Armed with a blend of theoretical knowledge and hands-on experience, I am committed to making meaningful contributions to the dynamic field of computing through innovative teaching, research, and collaboration.
