I am an Assistant Professor in the School of Computing at Grand Valley State University, primarily focused on the intricacies of machine learning and data mining.

Prior to joining GVSU, I worked extensively in the tech industry for over six years, concentrating on web application design and the development of machine learning systems. My experience in these realms allowed me to delve deep into practical implementations, marrying them seamlessly with my academic pursuits.

I completed my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Massachusetts Boston. My doctoral research revolved around creating applied machine learning algorithms aimed at solving complex, real-world computational challenges. My primary focus was on spatio-temporal analysis, time series forecasting, and the inventive application of causal analysis techniques in feature selection.

Beyond my academic and professional life, I have a penchant for outdoor activities, especially exploring city parks and hiking, and I often indulge in board games or video games with friends and family. I also have a keen interest in cinema, particularly the James Bond series, which has been a perennial favorite.
