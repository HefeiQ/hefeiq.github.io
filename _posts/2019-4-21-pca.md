### What is Principal Component Analysis?
Principal component analysis(PCA) is a dimensionality-reduction method commonly used to reduct the dimensionality of large datasets by transforming a large set of variables into a smaller one that still contains most of the information in the large set.

Reducing the number of variables in a dataset naturally comes at the expense of accuracy. Its trick is sacrificing a little accuracy for simplicity. Because smaller datasets are easier to explore and visualize and make data analysis easier and faster for machine learning algorithms without dealing with extraneous variables.
### Eigen decomposition of a square matrix

What exactly happens when a matrix is multiplied by a vector? Suppose 

$$ A = \begin{bmatrix} 3 & 1 \\ 1 & 2\end{bmatrix}; x =  \begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\ x_2\end{bmatrix}$$

Then $$Ax = b = \begin{bmatrix} 3x_1+x_2 \\ x_1+2x_2\end{bmatrix}$$
It can be seen that the multipling $$A$$ by $$x$$ is to recombine the elements of $$x$$ in a linear manner to obtain $$b$$. This recombination is called linear transformation.

if we keep the norm of $$x$$ satisfies the following condition. 

$$x_1^2+x_2^2 = 1$$
