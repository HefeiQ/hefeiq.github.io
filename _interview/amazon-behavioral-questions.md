### Why [Company]?
- Why Amazon?
- Why do you want to make a move?
- What do you looking for for your next role?
    - First, values customer obsession --> better product and software --> my dream is to design products that meet real human needs.
    - Secondly, machine learning --> Amazon is a pioneer of creative applications of machine learning.
    - Lastly, labmate Alexa team --> ongoing learning opportunities --> a workspace that values my learning and development.

### Customer Obssession
##### Customer interaction
- Tell me a time you made a suggestion for clients?
- When you're working with a large number of customers, it's tricky to deliever excellent service to them all. So how do you go about prioritizing your customer's needs?


- Describe a difficult interaction you had with your client
- Tell me about a time that customers tell you they want something but you know that's not really what they want.
- When do you think it is ok to push back or say no to an unreasonable customer request?
- Tell me about a project that you think the requirements are unreasonable or can't be done.
- When your delivery is different from your customer's expection.
- Give me an example of a time when you did not meet a client's expection. What happened, and how did you attempt to rectify the situation?
- Who was your most challenging customer? 
##### Above & beyond
- Tell me about a time when you went above and beyond for a client?
- Tell me about a time you came up with a solution that customers didn't ask and they ended up liking it.
    - S: wordpress server is broken;  website files lost; high maintenance cost
    - T: setup the server and rebuild KDLab website 
    - A: github page --> avoid server broken; Jekyll --> easy to update with makedown; Scalable -- labmates' personal websites.
    - R: satify; quick developing; be easily maintained and updated.
    - L: long term goal. 
    
### Are right a lot
##### mistake/failure
- Tell me about a time you failed/were wrong/ made a mistake/ had an error in judgment/made a bad decision/regret.
- Tell me about a time when you made a bad/wrong decision and the learning from the experience enabled you to make a good decision later. What did you learn that you were able to apply?

##### interpersonal conflict
- Tell me about a time you disagreed with a colleague or boss. What is the process you used to work it out?
- Tell me about a time you disagreed with a colleague or boss and you were right.
- Tell me about a time you disagreed with a colleague or boss and you were wrong.

##### judement form incomplete data
- Tell me about a time when you had to work with incomplete data or information.

### Ownership
##### Above & beyond
- Provide an example of when you personally demonstrate ownership
- Tell me about a time when you went above and beyond?
- Tell me about a time you decided to take on a project instead of being assigned to you.
- Tell me about a time you step outside your job scope and solved a problem.
    - S: Plan to release a predictive model for predicting end-of-life care patients. A colleague -->generated samples --> built a Random Forest model --> over 80% accuracy. I discussed with him on this project.
    <!-- Because of his thesis defense, he needs to leave for 1 month.  -->
    - T: I just finished my auto-ML framework, and I used this project to evaluate my framework.
    - A: generated samples --> ML framework --> up to 65% accuracy, even a random forest. my framework on his samples -- > over 80%. check correlation --> 1 feature strongly related. weird. 1 on 1 meeting --> "prev-hospital stay" includes the current hospital stay.
    - R: Bugs fixed before model release. 

##### Pushback & Conflicting
- Did you have to pushback a request/task?
- If you have conflicting goals, how do you make trade-offs?
- Tell me about a time when you had to leave a task unfinished.
- Tell me about a time you had to sacrifice short term gains for long term goals.
- Tell me about a time when you had to work on a project with unclear responsibilities.
    - S: wordpress server is broken;  website files lost; 
    - T: Advisor --> setup the server and rebuild KDLab website.  
    - A: avoid high maintenance cost; github page --> avoid server broken; Jekyll --> easy to update with markdown; Scalable -- labmates' personal websites. 
    - R: I build the framework -->(same time) every member finish his/her part using markdown; satify; quick developing; be easily maintained and updated.
    - L: long term goal. 

##### Transition
- Describe a time you transitioned a project to another person/team.
    - S: graduate
    - T: Jekyll framework to new Ph.D.
    - A: 1 on 1 meeting --> training step-by-step --> documents --> actively answer all the questions in the following days.
    - R: new Ph.D. continue updating the KDL website, and published some new website using this framework.

##### Help peers
- Give an example of when you saw a peer struggling and decide to set in and help. What was the situation and what actions did you take? What was the outcome?
    - S: new Ph.D. --> create two websites: WIS and Tech-writing workshop
    - T: Jekyll framework to new Ph.D.
    - A: 1 on 1 meeting --> training step-by-step --> documents --> actively answer all the questions in the following days.
    - R: new Ph.D. continue updating the KDL website, and published some new website using this framework.
    
### Bias for action
##### Calculated risk
- Describe a time you take a big risk.
    - S: map-based-after-sale-system. google api for business need to pay. 
    - T: it is an after sale system that used for our after sale staffs. no budget for google api.
    - A: no need high security; no high query requests/s; free map api -- risk -- work well?  limited time --> feew basic functions quickly tried and released for fundamental uses.
    - R: 72 after sale staff for the 1st round test, design query requests queue to avoid the request conflicts. achieve the basic goal, not perfect, loading time.

##### incomplete/missing information
- Tell me about a time you needed to get information from someone who wasn't very responsive. What did you do.
    - S: map-based-after-sale-system. 
    - T: free map api. small community, limited documents, long time response, hard deadline.
    - A: basic functions quickly tried and released for fundamental uses. design query requests queue to avoid the request conflicts. 
    - R: 72 after sale staff for the 1st round test, achieve the basic goal, not perfect, loading time. --> map server.

##### take action & moving fast
- S: company join exhibition; payment machines; map-based-after-sale-system;
- T: free map api. small community, limited documents, long time response, hard deadline.
- A: basic functions quickly tried and released for fundamental uses. design query requests queue to avoid the request conflicts. 
- R: persentation succeed and got a big order.

### Think big
- S: 1st task during intership
- T: patient discharge prediction model, different datasets, has other prediction requirements. 
- A: NLP; feature selection; model selection; Auto-ML framework 
- R: design a non-historical record based model with an average precision improvement of 17%.

### Invent & Simplify

### Learn, and Be curious
- S: non-historical record based model
- T: non-historical record based model. 
- A: NLP --> new tokens --> [expanding abbreviations; correcting misspellings; removing stopwords; stemming] -- tfidf, w2v; pca, t-sne(t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding) to check word similarity
- R: design a non-historical record based model with an average precision improvement of 17%.


### Dive Deep
- S: Plan to release a predictive model for predicting end-of-life care patients. A colleague -->generated samples --> built a Random Forest model --> over 80% accuracy. I discussed with him on this project.
<!-- Because of his thesis defense, he needs to leave for 1 month.  -->
- T: I just finished my auto-ML framework, and I used this project to evaluate my framework.
- A: generated samples --> ML framework --> up to 65% accuracy, even a random forest. my framework on his samples -- > over 80%. check correlation --> 1 feature strongly related. weird. 1 on 1 meeting --> "prev-hospital stay" includes the current hospital stay.
- R: Bugs fixed before model release.

- R: 72 after sale staff for the 1st round test, achieve the basic goal, not perfect, loading time. --> map server.

### Insist on the highest standards
- Tell me about a time when you couldn't meet your expections on a project.    
- S: HF model, paper submit deadline. 
- T: plan to design HF as a high level framework that work for all deep models.
- A: architectures are different, impossible to have 1 framework for all architectures. 
- R: HF for recurrent neural network, working on the HF for transformer.
