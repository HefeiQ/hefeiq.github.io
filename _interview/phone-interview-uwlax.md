### Persional questions

**Are you still interested in the position? or Why us? or What attracts you to this position, both in terms of the department and the university as a regional institution?**
Thanks for asking! I'm really interested in the position for a few reasons.

- First, I love teaching. It's so rewarding when my students enjoy my courses or when I can help them find jobs or internships. Since teaching always plays an important role in regional institutions, I think it's a great fit for me.

- Secondly, I'm also enjoy research. I've published 7 papers in areas like AI, ML, and Data Mining, and I'd love to get more students involved in these fields. Your department places a high value on undergraduate research and collaboration, so I'm excited about continuing my work with undergrads there.

- Thirdly, I noticed that the student-to-faculty ratio at UWLax is just 19:1, and 91% of classes have fewer than 50 students. I think that's great because it allows for closer relationships between students and faculty.

- I really appreciate the smaller size of the department. It's similar to the CS department at UMB, where all the faculty members are friendly, and we feel like a family. Every professor knows about my research and has given me valuable advice. I truly enjoy the atmosphere in such a close-knit group.

**Introduce yourself**
Hello everyone, I'm Yong Zhuang, and I got my Ph.D. in Computer Science and applied ML from the University of Massachusetts Boston, where I worked with Dr. Wei Ding. My research interests are pretty broad, covering Machine Learning, Big Data Analysis, Feature Selection, Spatio-temporal Data Analysis, and Time Series Prediction. I've published 7 papers in these area.

In addition to research, I've been a teaching assistant for a bunch of courses, like Artificial Intelligence, Big Data Analysis, and Introduction to Computing. I also worked at the student success center as an instructor, helping disadvantaged students succeed in tough courses like Theory of Computation, Data Structures, and Algorithms.

Before my study at UMASS Boston, I worked as a software engineer for five years. That job gave me tons of experience in application design, data management, code design, debugging, and testing, which has been super helpful for my teaching and research. I've also worked as a machine learning scientist and engineer during internships and after my PhD program. This has given me valuable experience in designing machine learning systems.

I look forward to being a part of this community and making meaningful contributions to the department.

**Brief Describe your research**
My research majorly focuses on long-term predictive modeling of big spatio-temporal data. This field presents unique challenges because spatio-temporal modeling deals with nonlinear correlations over time and space, making long-term predictions particularly difficult due to the rapid accumulation of errors.

One of my contributions is identifying subsets of features that are both highly predictable and explainable. I collaborated with Professor Islam from Tufts university to design a new multi-Markov-Blankets-based ensemble model called Galaxy, which we presented at ICBK 2018. This approach improves long-term extreme rainfall  prediction performance through ensemble learning on selected predictable and explainable features and helped us identify cold waves along the Asian coast as a significant precursor to U.S. surface weather.

I've also looked into how we can extend the prediction horizon of time series in chaotic systems. I proposed a new recurrent architecture and corresponding training approach on deep recurrent models, extending the prediction horizon by more than 20%. This work was presented at the IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM) in 2022. Additionally, I collaborated with a team at UMASS Lowell to design a spatio-temporal deep neural network for predicting crime hotspots, which was published in ICBK 2017.

So, as you can see, my research interests span various aspects of spatio-temporal data and predictive modeling. I'm excited to continue exploring these areas and find innovative solutions to their challenges.
 
 **What is topic of your dissertation?**

My dissertation is mainly focuses on long-term predictive modeling of big spatio-temporal data. This field presents unique challenges because spatio-temporal modeling deals with nonlinear correlations over time and space. With the dimensionality of the time and space measurements increasing, the number of elements potentially contributing to a target sharply grows, making the target's long-term behavior highly complex, chaotic, highly dynamic, and hard to predict. So my study focus on two challenges:

 - big dimensionality: I use feature selection to identify the most relevant and meaningful features from the original Spatio-temporal feature space in order to improve learning accuracy, reduces the computation time, and facilitates an enhanced understanding for the learning model and data. 

 - Second, forecasting long-term dynamics in nonlinear chaotic systems can be pretty tricky because of how sensitive they are to initial conditions and how errors can grow exponentially. So, I proposed a new recurrent architecture called error trajectory tracking to better evaluate the consequences of local errors when modeling nonlinear systems. This model can help us make more reliable predictions further into the future.

**What industrial experience do you have?**

Before starting my studies at UMASS Boston, I worked as a software engineer, primarily focusing on web application development. I led both frontend and backend teams in developing a GIS-based Geological Hazard Management System (GHMS) for tasks like data collection, synchronization, and risk scoring. We used technologies such as C#, ASP.Net, Oracle, MS SQL Server, LINQ, CSS, jQuery, AJAX, JSON, and ArcGIS.

I also led teams in creating an after-sales service management platform that streamlined the after-sale service process, making it more efficient and improving customer satisfaction. We used technologies like C#, ASP.Net, MVC, jQuery, AJAX, and Bing Map for that project.

Additionally, I participated in the development of a secure remote solution for bank terminals, which enabled web-based remote control and system updates. We utilized C#, ASP.Net, AJAX, MS SQL Server, CSS, JavaScript, video conversion, and Bing Map for this project.

I've worked as a machine learning scientist at Radial Analytics during my internship, I used Python, Tensorflow, AWS, NLP, feature selection, and deep learning to design a machine learning system to automatically generate predictive models for given needs. I have aslo worked as a machine learning engineer at Constant Contact after my PhD program. I used Python, and AWS to build a machine learning system to estimate customer lifetime value (CLV) to help marketing teams develop marketing strategies.

### Teaching related questions

**What teaching experience do you have?**

I spent four semesters working as an instructor at the student success center, helping students succeed in their CS courses like Theory of Computation, Data Structures, and Algorithms. Every week, I'd give a 60-minute presentation where I'd:

- Offer practical guidance and answer specific questions.
- Preview upcoming course content, assignments, and predict future challenges.

I also served as a teaching assistant for five semesters in courses such as Artificial Intelligence, Big Data Analysis, and Introduction to Computing. My responsibilities included:

**What other types of courses would you be interested in developing and teaching?**

Considering my research background, I'm really interested in developing and teaching courses related to machine learning and data mining. This could include topics like deep learning, reinforcement learning, natural language processing, large language models, and time series analysis. I'm excited to share my knowledge and expertise in these areas, and I believe they will be beneficial to the students and the department as a whole.

**What kind of split are you looking for between teaching and research?**

Well, I believe that teaching and research are equally important aspects of an academic career, so I'd like to give enough time to both. This way, I can effectively teach and guide students while also pursuing my research interests.

In the beginning of my career, I think I'll spend more time on teaching since developing curricula and support materials might need extra effort. During this time, I expect to spend about 60% of my time on teaching and 40% on research. As I get more comfortable with teaching and streamline my processes, I plan to adjust the balance, with 40% to teaching and 60% to research. 

**How to deal with various(diverse) student backgrounds? or What do you find challenging about teaching?**

In my CS Seminar class, (I found the most challenge part in teaching is the diverse backgrounds of the students.) more than half of the students are non-majors and don't have any programming experience. And some have part-time jobs and can't be on campus most of the time. 

- My first strategy is to learn about my students' backgrounds as soon as possible. During the first week, I give them homework where they introduce themselves and tell me about their programming experience and how many hours they work if they have part-time jobs. In the next two weeks, I give two ungraded quizzes to see if they can keep up. With this information, I can adjust my course schedule to make sure most students don't fall behind.

- Second, I offer extra support for those who are less prepared. For example, I hold additional review sessions to give more guidance and help them build the foundational knowledge they need. For students who can't be on campus often, I use online discussion sections so they can ask questions after class.

- Lastly, I encourage peer-to-peer learning in the classroom by promoting collaboration and exchanging diverse perspectives. By giving group projects, creating study groups, and fostering a supportive learning environment, students can learn from each other and develop essential skills like communication, problem-solving, and teamwork. 

**How to involve undergraduate student in your research?**

- First, I would come up with engaging topics and projects that connect to real-life situations. This way, students can see the value in participating and feel motivated to join in.
- While teaching, I would offer research-based projects or assignments to students who express interest in getting involved. 
- In addition, I could organize seminars to share my research, interact with students, and encourage them to take part in the projects. By making the research approachable and exciting, I can create opportunities for undergraduates to contribute actively.

**How do you combine research and teaching?**

The main purpose of undergraduate research-based teaching at the classroom guidance level is to highlight the research characteristics of important knowledge points in addition to imparting knowledge, inspiring students to take the initiative in thinking, guiding them to understand, analyze and solve problems, and stimulating their interest in research and the application of learned knowledge and methods to practical situations. 

To achieve this, I'll provide students with state-of-the-art algorithm literature and let them choose an existing algorithm or create a new one to tackle real-world challenges. Finally, students will compete against each other, with the winner earning a bonus on their final grade.

**How to collaborate with our faculty?**

I noticed that Dr. Mathias /mai sai i s/ is interested in genetic algorithms. Right now, I'm working on a project that explores using reinforcement learning in symbolic regression, which is inspired by genetic programming. I think there might be an opportunity for us to collaborate on this.

As I found Dr. Sauppe /s au/'s research focuses on causal inference. A current popular research topic is integrating causal inference into deep learning. I am very interested in it and I believe there could be a chance for us to work together on this as well.

**What is your strengths and weaknesses in teaching and research**

- When it comes to teaching, one of my strong points is that I can simplify complex ideas into more manageable and easy-to-understand concepts. I find that using real-world examples and analogies helps make the material more relatable and engaging for students. 
- However, as a non-native speaker, I do have an accent /ˈækˌsɛnt/ in my English, but I like to use slides and figures to make my explanations clearer.

- Regarding research, I enjoy taking on tough challenges and discovering novel methods to solve them. My persistence also helps me overcome any difficulties or challenges that I may encounter in my research.

- On the flip side, one of my research weaknesses is that I can sometimes get too focused on a specific aspect, which narrows my perspective. To solve this, I actively seek feedback from colleagues and participate in conferences and workshops to widen my understanding and gain insights from other experts in my field.

**What do you see as the role of computer science in a liberal arts setting?**

In a liberal /lib(ə)rəl/ arts setting, computer science benefits both CS majors and students from other fields. CS majors get a broader range of knowledge, which can inspire their studies, like in the popular research area of computer science education. Meanwhile, students from other majors can use computer science as a powerful tool in today's digital world. So, having a computer science department is essential in a liberal arts school.
