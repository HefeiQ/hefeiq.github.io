**Tell me about yourself**

A lot of jobs require someone who can think on their feet or present ideas with crispness and clarity. This question provides employers with an early preview of your core skills, your personality and your ability to respond to an unstructured question.

My name is Yong Zhuang, and I have received my Ph.D. in Computer Sciencee and is a member of the Knowledge Discovery Lab at the University of Massachusetts Boston. My research interests include deep learning, feature selection, and time series prediction.

I would describe myself as highly curious and focused on learning in all parts of life.

Before my Study at UMASS Boston, I worked as a software engineer for 5 years. During that time, I led a team building a GIS-based Hazard Management System on both the client- and server-side. This helped me to accumulate a wealth of programming experience in JavaScript and Web-service development to collect and manage data. This job also made me realize if I want to get more information from data, I should get exposed to data mining and machine learning.

During my Ph.D. study, I look for the hardest problems to solve and where I can learn and develop the most. I’ve taken on severial real-world research projects, including crime hotspots prediction, heavy rainfall events prediction, and long term time sequences prediction in chaos system. I also spent a 6-months internship at Radial Analytics, and collaborate with a large health care system to use machine learning technology to help hospital systems and physician networks provide patients with more effective care to meet their individual needs.
 

In my professional life, I look for the hardest problems to solve and where I can learn and develop the most. I’ve taken on many different types of projects, including ads, virtual reality, commerce, and messaging. No matter what I’m working on, I’m very invested. I identify anyone I can learn from, as well as problems that I care about and try to optimize every step of the process.

 

In my personal life, I spend a lot of time reading and usually have a focused area of interest for a longer period of time. For instance, last year, I read and researched public transportation systems and the future of transportation with emerging companies and autonomous vehicles. I found it fascinating, and it actually sparked a desire to change industries — which eventually led me to my last role and even helped prepare me for the switch.

 

Outside of reading and researching, I also love to travel, cook with friends, and spend a lot of time running and being physically active outdoors.


Now, the reason I'm so interested in this position is that it seems to provide a really great blend of keep learning and hands-on problem-solving.
