The CS Seminar provides academic support to students enrolled in various computer science courses, such as **Intermediate Computing with Data Structures (CS210)**, **Advanced Data Structures and Algorithms (CS310)**, and **Theory of Computation (CS420)**. Following the program of study detailed in each course syllabus, it offers customized tutoring on an individual basis or in small groups to cater to specific student needs. By attending the CS Seminar, students benefit from additional practice with content specific to their respective courses.

- I delivered weekly 60-minute presentations, covering the material for computer science courses.
- I dedicated 30 minutes to offering practical guidance and answering specific questions.
- I also allocated 30 minutes to previewing upcoming course content, assignments, and discussing potential future challenges.
