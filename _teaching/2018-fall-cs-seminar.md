The CS Seminar offers academic support to students enrolled in various computer science courses (e.g., CS210, CS310, CS420) and follows the program of study outlined in each syllabus. It offers individual and small-group tutoring that is tailored
to specific student needs. Thus, by attending the CS Seminar, students get the added benefit of extra practice with their course-specific content.
- I delivered a 60-minute presentations weekly, covering the materials in computer science courses (e.g., CS210, CS310, CS420). 
- I spent 30 minutes to provide practical guidance and answer specific questions.
- I spent 30 minutes previewing upcoming course content, assignments and predicting future challenges.
