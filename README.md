# Yong's Personal Website using Jekyll

This repository contains the code for my personal website built using Jekyll. The design is based on the [al-folio](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio) Jekyll theme, which was forked and customized to fit my needs.

## Usage

To use this repository, you will need to have Jekyll installed on your machine. Once installed, you can clone this repository and run the following command to build and serve the website locally:

```
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

You can then view the website by navigating to `http://localhost:4000` in your web browser.

## Customization

To customize the website, you can modify the various files and configurations in the `_config.yml`, `_data`, `_includes`, `_layouts`, `_sass`, and `assets` directories. You can also modify the content of the website by editing the Markdown files in the `_posts` and `pages` directories.

## Acknowledgments
