    <p><strong>Tell me about yourself</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A lot of jobs require someone who can think on their feet or present ideas with crispness and clarity. This question provides employers with an early preview of your core skills, your personality and your ability to respond to an unstructured question.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My name is Yong Zhuang, and I have received my Ph.D. in Computer Sciencee and is a member of the Knowledge Discovery Lab at the University of Massachusetts Boston. My research interests include deep learning, feature selection, and time series prediction.</p>

<p>I would describe myself as highly curious and focused on learning in all parts of life.</p>

<p>Before my Study at UMASS Boston, I worked as a software engineer for 5 years. During that time, I led a team building a GIS-based Hazard Management System on both the client- and server-side. This helped me to accumulate a wealth of programming experience in JavaScript and Web-service development to collect and manage data. This job also made me realize if I want to get more information from data, I should get exposed to data mining and machine learning.</p>

<p>During my Ph.D. study, I look for the hardest problems to solve and where I can learn and develop the most. I‚Äôve taken on severial real-world research projects, including crime hotspots prediction, heavy rainfall events prediction, and long term time sequences prediction in chaos system. I also spent a 6-months internship at Radial Analytics, and collaborate with a large health care system to use machine learning technology to help hospital systems and physician networks provide patients with more effective care to meet their individual needs.</p>

<p>In my professional life, I look for the hardest problems to solve and where I can learn and develop the most. I‚Äôve taken on many different types of projects, including ads, virtual reality, commerce, and messaging. No matter what I‚Äôm working on, I‚Äôm very invested. I identify anyone I can learn from, as well as problems that I care about and try to optimize every step of the process.</p>

<p>In my personal life, I spend a lot of time reading and usually have a focused area of interest for a longer period of time. For instance, last year, I read and researched public transportation systems and the future of transportation with emerging companies and autonomous vehicles. I found it fascinating, and it actually sparked a desire to change industries ‚Äî which eventually led me to my last role and even helped prepare me for the switch.</p>

<p>Outside of reading and researching, I also love to travel, cook with friends, and spend a lot of time running and being physically active outdoors.</p>

<p>Now, the reason I‚Äôm so interested in this position is that it seems to provide a really great blend of keep learning and hands-on problem-solving.</p>

<p><strong>What is your greatest strength?</strong></p>

<p>My most vital strength is my work ethic. I am willing to step into any project when needed. I‚Äôm not afraid to take on challenging tasks because I believe I can learn and develop the most from them. No matter what I‚Äôm doing, I‚Äôm very involved. I respect anyone I can learn from. I pride myself on being able to step into any task to get the best possible result for the team. I also prefer teamwork. I work well to inspire diverse team members and work side by side with them to achieve project goals.</p>

<p><strong>What is your greatest weakness?</strong></p>

<p>My greatest weakness is when I get a task, I focus on it and work hard to complete it. However, when I come across new projects, sometimes I need to stop the projects I‚Äôm working on and jump right into those new projects. Switching between tasks multiple times throughout the day <strong>hinders my productivity and prevents me from doing my best work</strong>. I‚Äôve been using project management tools to help me manage my tasks and time, which has helped me <strong>be more aware of priorities</strong>. Since implementing this project management mindset, I have only increased my <strong>efficiency</strong> and <strong>productivity</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Why should we hire you?</strong></p>

<p>My background in machine learning and software engineering has taught me extensive experience designing models and implementing them. I also have the ability to connect and influence team members to achieve project goals. I believe these will be crucial in this position.</p>

<p>I am motivated and excited to learn about the company‚Äôs culture and work style, and from my interactions with other team members, I can see that we share values such as respect, trust, and excellence. Overall, I believe I bring the right mix of skills, experience, and attitudes to the job and feel that my diverse experience can add a lot of value here.</p>

<p><strong>Why do you want to work here?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Tell me about a time you showed leadership.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Tell me about a time you were successful on a team.</strong></p>

<p><strong>What would your co-workers say about you?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Why do you want to leave your current role?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Describe your most challenging project.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Tell me about something you‚Äôve accomplished that you are proud of.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Can you explain your employment gap?</strong></p>

<p><strong>What are your salary expectations?</strong></p>

<p><strong>What do you like to do outside of work?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Tell me about a time you had to manage conflicting priorities.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Where do you see yourself in 5 years?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Describe your leadership style.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Tell me about a time you failed or made a mistake.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Tell me about a time you worked with a difficult person.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Tell me about a time you had to persuade someone.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Tell me about a time you disagreed with someone.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Tell me about a time you created a goal and achieved it.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Tell me about a time you surpassed people‚Äôs expectations.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Tell me about a time you had to handle pressure.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Tell me about a time you had to learn something quickly.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Do you have any questions for me?</strong>
    <strong>Work overtime</strong>
        - How responsive are people to email/Slack over the weekends and after 6 PM?
        - Are there times of the month, quarter, or year when the team is most busy?
    <strong>Work place and work time</strong>
    - Will I be working with anyone who is remote, or who works from home on a regular basis?
    - Do centain projects require more face-to-face time than others?
    <strong>Work environment</strong>
    - Who sets deadlines and what happens when people fail to meet them?
    - Can you give me an example of a mistake you‚Äôve made here, and how it was handled?
    <strong>Career growth</strong>
    - Did any of your senior start out as junior here?
    = what percentage of managers within the company were promoted internally?
    - (For manager or lead) What made you decide to interview external candidate like me for this role?</p>
